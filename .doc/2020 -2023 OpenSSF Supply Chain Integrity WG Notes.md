Agenda/notes:



* Direction and priorities for 2024
    * Reprised the quarterly TAC review, [ssci.io/sci-deck](ssci.io/sci-deck)
    * Directions in 2024:
        * SLSA, new tracks
        * S2C2F, attestation format
        * gittuf, enabling SLSA Source track
        * GUAC, continuing supply chain metadata aggregation and synthesis
    * For the TAC
        * WG landscape: current WGs have evolved organically and split simultaneously by audience (e.g., End Users), by approach (e.g., Tooling), and by domain (e.g., Supply Chain Integrity). Some centrally-guided refactoring could be useful.
        * Technical and architectural biases: could be good to have more formal and deliberate biases in technology and architecture across OpenSSF, e.g., in-toto should be a default choice for attestation format.
    * Note that there is now a ‚ÄúWG Leads‚Äù meta-WG for better coordination, information sharing, etc., across the OpenSSF
* OpenSSF Elections are upon us
    * TAC is expanding from 7 seats to 9 seats
    * Going forward, elections will be staggered to split up TAC turnover
    * TAC election timeline
        * Nominations Open: NOW
        * Nominations CLOSE: Dec 15
        * Voting Starts: December 16
        * Voting Stops:  December 30
        * New members seated: January 1
    * To request a ballot that we sent through [OpaVote please fill out this google form](https://forms.gle/7suYexAnPxndvX856).
    * To run for the TAC:
        * [SCIR Member GB Nomination Form](https://forms.gle/ZZkC6zK3T7Ww43uC9)
        * [TAC Community Seat Self-Nomination Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMkN_H3zVFW7NfZzsanF5isga3PNVUQj7-8VPlVPhb2F2iYQ/viewform)
* SCI WGs inventory and possible refactor
    * Probably time that we take a look at various WG meetings in SCI-land
        * e.g., SCI Positioning was originally chartered with creating clarity wrt various in-motion standards and frameworks last year. Is it still needed?
    * SCI Positioning now very active driving blogs, conferences, papers etc.
        * Perhaps this is now ‚ÄúSCI Evangelism‚Äù or such? Confusion between SBOM, SSDF, SLSA, S2C2F, etc., seems to have diminished
    * We could start by listing out what we have and going from there
* CFP just dropped for OSS NA
    * Closes 1/14
    * [https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/program/cfp/](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/program/cfp/)

Agenda:



* :03 Welcome new friends (Isaac Hepworth) 
    * Hi Dana!
* :05 New project additions to SCI WG üôå (Isaac Hepworth)
    * Welcome gittuf üéâ
    * Welcome GUAC ü•≥
* :10 Rebuilding OSS (Matthew Suozzo)
    * [[link to slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OqIy1_X-aev_9glnBXmhb2azqe2D2YP_4vohmpAARrs/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-Z5kiNbjU9EAwP9lCl5yITQ)]
    * Question about reuse of existing reproducible build work
        * Matt‚Äôs in touch with maintainer of [https://github.com/kpcyrd/rebuilderd](https://github.com/kpcyrd/rebuilderd) 
            * Presented earlier version of this work at reproducible builds workshop last year
            * Foundational work has been vital to enable the plausibility of this project
        * For language packages, much of the complexity is in the inference/heuristics side, where existing work on OS packages has limited reuse value
        * Long-term, plausibly makes sense to converge the projects
    * Question about how much of the 67% reproducible required human intervention
        * 67% is ‚Äúsemi-automated‚Äù with light human review of heuristically-derived build process
        * Human inputs were as it happened ~reliably recreatable using COTS LLM
    * Question about the distribution story for attestations coming from rebuilds
        * Intent to reuse as much of Sigstore/Rekor/Cosign as possible
        * BUT indeed rebuilder can‚Äôt push provenance to the original package location
    * Question as to whether ‚Äúrebuild‚Äù attestations are special/custom
        * It's implemented as SLSA Provenance
        * In more detail, it's actually several since the 'build' is run separately from the 'compare' for isolation purposes so both of them get provenance.
    * Question re: ‚Äúwhen can we play with this?!‚Äù
        * Talk at PackingCon coming up; hoping to have code published shortly
    * ‚ÄúI feel like there's an opportunity for rebuilders to add scorecard like checks, running vulnerability scans on the source, checking for PR approvals, git commit signing, etc.‚Äù - Brandon Mitchell
* :40 in-toto across OpenSSF (John Kjell)
    * Many of the security properties of interest could be captured as in-toto attestations; do we see as a group that as the right general direction?
    * Desire for more specificity as to shared schemas, common semantics, etc. to make machine readability more tractable
    * How can we evolve standardized predicates over time?
        * some core standard set
        * some set of vendor extensions (like ‚ÄúX-‚Äù HTTP headers)
        * some set of loosely experimental etc.
        * This is encoded today in [https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/docs/new_predicate_guidelines.md#vetting-process](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/docs/new_predicate_guidelines.md#vetting-process) 
    * How do we settle on in-toto across OpenSSF?
        * Perhaps driving via the TAC? mike@kusari.dev could help here.
    * Need to settle on a consumption story, too. Generation of in-toto is just one part

Agenda



* :03 Welcome new friends üëã
    * Chad Kimes (GitHub)
    * Patricia Tarro (Dell)
* :05 SCI and SLSA Scope (Isaac)
    * Thoughts on trajectory of SLSA expanding to ‚Äúfill‚Äù SCI WG scope
    * Questions about S2C2F and dependency track of SLSA
    * Attempt of ‚Äòcontrol plane‚Äô concept to pull together raw materials into a more coherent whole
* :15 Build environment attestations (Marcela / Chad)
    * [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11cycDxYaoZpuG144pR6atI1_zk2CfZOWlNO_f_HhhyE/edit?usp=sharing)
    * Framing: Threats to the Build Environment
        * SLSA defines trusted build platforms
        * Assume build platforms are not malicious
        * Build platforms are not perfect
        * Assuming temporary breach, what are the possible threats?
        * How can we protect against those?
    * Threats to the Build Environment
        * Tampering with
            * image generation or boot process
            * build init or build execution
            * control plane
            * build cache
        * Install malicious bootloader or kernel
            * Very difficult to detect without hardware measurement
        * Modify/compromise build software (compilers, package managers)
        * Install persistent backdoors
        * Poison build outputs or inputs
        * Attacker goals:
            * Poison build outputs
            * Access CI/CD secrets

* (Very High-level) Trusted Hardware Background
    * Static attestations:
        * Capture launch-time state
        * Examples: Intel SGX, AMD SEV
    * "Dynamic" attestations
        * State can be re-measured as new code is loaded onto the platform
        * Examples: TPMs, Intel TDX
    * Confidential compute platforms:
        * Memory is encrypted and integrity-protected during execution
        * Some provide remote attestation features (including via RATS)
        * Examples: Intel SGX, AMD SEV, Intel TDX, ARM TrustZone
* Providing Build Environment Integrity
    * Goal: To provide build integrity _even in the face of control plane compromise_
    * UEFI Secure Boot + TPM Attestation
        * Remotely validate Secure Boot parameters
        * Remotely validate bootloader, kernel, initramfs
        * Validate build environment image
            * Currently limited ecosystem support, possible with dm-verity
    * Confidential Computing (Intel SGX, Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SP)
        * Fully encrypted execution environment
        * Remotely attestable
        * Provides hardening against control plane attacks
        * Caveat: Intel SGX mostly suitable for smaller-scale, highly sensitive operations like signing
* PROPOSAL: A new SLSA track for Attested Build Environment

  * Question about trust anchor and who makes/signs attestations
      * Trust would be delegated to the platform provider
  * Question about intersection/overlap with ‚ÄúBuild L4‚Äù
      * View of hermeticity as a property of the build environment rather than the build process
  * Question about what is realizable today with common hardware capabilities
      * Validate bootchain
      * Support needed on both hardware and software sides
  * ‚ÄúTrust but verify‚Äù approach
* Need to figure out how to ‚Äòland‚Äô this in SLSA itself
  * We don‚Äôt yet have a set of principles to guide creation of new tracks etc.
  * Good next step could be discussion in SLSA Specification WG

    * Discussion
        * Admission control as a broad concept
            * Runtime, yes, e.g., ‚Äútraditional‚Äù k8s admission control
                * Although for runtime, *evaluations* should occur to the left, ahead of time (and be captured in a signed VSA, for example)
            * But also for artifact registries, source management, dependencies etc.!

Agenda



* Welcome new friends
    * nobody today!
* Update on SSP
    * Since last time‚Ä¶
        * Isaac Hepworth [wrote to](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C01A1MA7A1K/p1691422014681679) the TAC/GB
        * Anecdotally, many many other folks in OpenSSF WGs have the same concerns, questions, frustration, and curiosity
        * Omkhar (OpenSSF GM) responded ‚Äúa doc is going through a GC review that compares and contrasts OpenSSF and the proposed scope of SSP. Once this doc is relatively stable, we can share more with the community‚Äù
        * OpenSSF Governing Board will be discussing this Thursday Aug 17, 2023
        * Stay tuned!
    * Jay: we need to have patience; there are more moving parts here than meet the eye
* Michael.Scovetta@microsoft.com: Assurance Assertions ([https://bit.ly/assuranceassertions](https://bit.ly/assuranceassertions)) 
    * [Pitch deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RlCw4ROQ4UTmaZ_dvaHgj1EUs_Vj4ZxyXxVFHmaht-k/edit?usp=sharing)
        * Vision - make informed decisions around what OSSW is consumed
        * Reduce analysis on the consumer-side and provide consumable data to consumers
        * Assertion examples
            * CVEs
            * Actively maintained
            * Code was reviewed by <entity>
            * Isaac - what is this tied to? Is the Subject a project, a repo, a build artifact, a developer, etc?
            * Marcela - Is this the same as the [in-toto attribute assertions](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/predicates/scai.md#model)? What are the differences? Intent is to align.
        * Architecture
            * Isaac - what‚Äôs the Assertion Store look like? PS flat database. How to get data? REST API
        * Demo
            * You could set a policy where no CVEs are allowed versus specific CVEs
            * Wrapper around the tool itself in order to trust the tool? 
                * Making the relationship between evidence and trustworthiness through assertions is definitely something that has been missing.
            * important point Michael S made there that matches my thought process: this should be separate, pluggable layers. The datastore and the policy layer as separate projects would give flexibility to keep the part that works as this project grows and experiments
        * Next step get a SIG. Michael to post further details in Slack
    * [Deep link](https://oafdev1.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com/assertions/show?subject_uuid=0c6aa7ec-b271-4906-989a-4e32d1dcbba1)

    * SCI WG process
        * Adding a project to a WG is in itself something of a work in progress
        * GUAC is a fit nominally for SCI WG vision, per our vision doc [OpenSSF SCI WG 2023 ‚Äî¬†EXTERNAL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SuJHaCr89Ih6TFvAIH2WM5M4_MlXwM8mqHynUBuungE/edit?resourcekey=0-wg-QROzZFa4Ju_uN_wOBNQ)
            * ‚ÄúUpstream security practices universally evaluable by downstream automation‚Äù
            * No objections, +1 from Melba and Marcela and Arnaud
            * [Isaac Hepworth](mailto:isaac.hepworth@gmail.com) will ping Slack and mailing list for feedback
                * Absent objections we‚Äôll consider adding GUAC to SCI WG the plan of record
* Next week‚Äôs review with the TAC ([Isaac Hepworth](mailto:isaac.hepworth@gmail.com))
    * Isaac will build draft deck and circulate
    * We have a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ossf/wg-supply-chain-integrity/issues/61) in the repo for TAC approval of Charter
    * SLSA ‚Äî 1.0, futures (Build L4, and other tracks)
    * S2C2F ‚Äî¬†leave blank slide(s) for Jay and Adrian
    * GUAC ‚Äî¬†summarize where we‚Äôre at
    * FRSCA ‚Äî¬†
        * It‚Äôs a reference implementation, not a production tool
        * We still have lots of idea, but relatively few resources to move it forward
        * Possible ‚ú®synergy‚ú® with Sterling Toolchain
            * FRSCA could be an implementation of the ST ref arch for Build
* [Melba] (5 mins) SCI Repo Changes + Charter Update
    * Melba did a bunch of cleanup in the repo
        * Cleaning up branches
        * Closing old issues
        * Posting/updating the charter
    * Melba also working with Jen Bly 
        * We need to find folks who can help with content: copyediting, video production, etc.
            * OpenSSF doesn‚Äôt have these skills on staff currently, but JBly looking into it
            * Feels like content production should be a core competency of OpenSSF?
    * Some continued operational challenges
        * Melba doesn‚Äôt have edit access to calendar, e.g.
* [Mike Lieberman] SCI API
    * Might be related to some sterling toolchain stuff
    * This group is building some tools and standards and there‚Äôs interest in helping define that unified API so that folks building SLSA, S2C2F, etc. tools can integrate.
    * Would be good to develop or settle on standards for pluggability of various capabilities in the supply chain
        * e.g., discovery of SLSA provenance, distribution of SBOMs, etc.
    * [CDEvents](https://cdevents.dev/) could be interesting or relevant as a common language
    * Idea of a ‚Äúsupply chain control plane‚Äù
        * Metadata fabric spanning SDLC
        * Actors in the supply chain and add metadata
        * Actors in the supply chain can query metadata, then evaluate and actuate policy
    * Marcela has been working on supply chain control plane concept
        * [Isaac Hepworth](mailto:isaac.hepworth@gmail.com) to schedule a look at it in a future SCI WG meeting

Agenda



* Welcome new friends!!
    * Matt Wood, working on internal adoption of SLSA at Intel. Motivations:
        * Goodness and light
        * Compliance too
* [Mike Lieberman] Updates from KubeCon EU
    * SLSA 1.0 announcement went over well.
        * Lots of excitement
        * Interest in the future roadmap with respect to evolution and addition of tracks
    * SLSA audits!
        * Prometheus and Argo had an audit through CNCF
        * They are looking to do more
        * They are looking to partner with OSTIF (also under LF) as the way CNCF pays for audits.
    * Some confusion around S2C2F. Folks have heard of it, but unsure where it fits in. Some folks have pointed out a lot of the documentation indicates it‚Äôs a Microsoft framework instead of an OpenSSF framework: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/opensource/osssscframeworkguide](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/opensource/osssscframeworkguide)
        * All maintainers being Microsoft employees doesn‚Äôt help
        * Some of the links point to: [https://github.com/microsoft/oss-ssc-framework](https://github.com/microsoft/oss-ssc-framework/issues) instead of [https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f](https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f)
            * [jaywhite@microsoft.com](mailto:jaywhite@microsoft.com) is already on a mission to chase these down and fix them
            * Notably, folks finding this stuff is encouraging in the sense that people are reading the docs :)
    * Desire for OpenSSF to take a larger part in helping define end to end supply chain security
        * Some folks aren‚Äôt ready for cloud native adoption yet, and want to better understand how to secure supply chain outside of cloud native tools.
        * Folks are asking for more diagrams and where SCI fits in.
        * Unclear if/when SCI will focus more on tooling.
            * We need to work out how we scope and drive this work in OpenSSF
                * slsa-tooling?
                * sci-tooling?
                * openssf-tooling?
            * Potentially we engage the TAC in helping to drive alignment?
* Question about when Hermeticity requirement will come back (removed in L4)
    * We need better definition around the precise requirement
        * ‚Äúhermetic‚Äù has some wiggle-room with various interpretations
        * Request from Matt T for recognition of the nuance around network access being allowed, but under controlled circumstances (e.g., metered, whitelisted, logged, etc.)
    * Anticipate a ‚ÄúSLSA Build L4‚Äù draft in the coming weeks, for community feedback and comment
    * Other additions on the radar
        * Source track
        * Securing custom build infra (e.g., not using a COTS SaaS tool)
* [OpenSSF SCI WG 2023 ‚Äî¬†EXTERNAL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SuJHaCr89Ih6TFvAIH2WM5M4_MlXwM8mqHynUBuungE/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-wg-QROzZFa4Ju_uN_wOBNQ) review and next steps 
    * We need to be cognizant of high bar of requirements for smaller software organizations
    * incentives in open source are worthy of note and recognition
        * OSS rebuilding could be part of the solution here
        * Aspiration of OSS could be to make builds readily operable by others
            * Pain when OOTB OSS builds fail, should be easily buildable by someone with SLSA-conformant builders
                * Example of Apache OSS
            * Possibly this is table stakes for mature OSS, even
                * new SLSA practice?
        * Observation of the overall ‚Äúaccountability gap‚Äù in open source
            * Red Hat has a business here, others nascently so

* [Michael Lieberman] (Kusari) - GUAC demo - approx 20 minutes
    * GUAC = Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition
    * Collaboration of Google, Kusari, Citi
    * Fundamental problem: transitive closure of dependencies affects you.
        * You may inject 10s of thousands of packages in an application, most won‚Äôt hurt you but one might.
        * Need a way to understand your data, like a telescope, can zoom in/out
        * Have too much data (many many packages)
        * Yet in other ways have too little data (data quality problems, unknown unknowns)
        * Need to understand relationships of data
    * GUAC is a software supply chain observatory - lets you see information
    * E.g., see GUAC image - many Python packages, many depend on containers, etc.
    * SLSA provides a lot more information about how the package was built
    * GUAC is a knowledge graph, enables analysis & synthesis. Builds on:
        * Trust foundation (sigstore is here)
        * Software attestations (SLSA is here)
    * GUAC enables you to be proactive & reactive
    * GUAC ingests many data sources into a graph database, currently neo4j
    * Two kinds of queries:
        * Informational (learn more about it)
        * Evidence (‚Äúhow do you know this claim is true?‚Äù)
    * Two main kinds of uses
        * Use only public data
        * Use private data (for a specific organization)
    * Demo!
        * E.g., run a query. E.g., ‚Äúwhat has SLSA attestations?‚Äù; ‚Äúwhat do I know about the builder for kubernetes?‚Äù
        * Can query on specific vulnerability (e.g., Log4Shell) & starting point, & it can list nodes via terminal or create a visualization showing the sequence that gets you there.
        * Q: Day-to-day, how would you use this? This couldn‚Äôt be done with so many vulnerabilities & packages.
        * Working on many other things as proof of concept
    * Follow-up
        * Project hosted at:[ https://github.com/guacsec/guac](https://github.com/guacsec/guac) 
        * GUAC Community mailing list:[ https://groups.google.com/g/guac-community](https://groups.google.com/g/guac-community) 
        * GUAC Community meetings monthly (Calendar Invite, Recordings:[ https://www.youtube.com/@guacsec)](https://www.youtube.com/@guacsec)) 
        * We are looking for devs/contributors! (issue#1)
        * The project will have Technical Advisory Members which are to inform the project. It is still a developer first project. (issue#1)
        * Kubecon 2022 Talk:[ https://sched.co/182Jr](https://sched.co/182Jr)
* Sterling Toolchains
    * OpenSSF governing board wishes to see more emphasis on automation
        * ‚ÄúSterling toolchain‚Äù was an idea which came from this
        * David co-authored a document to connect the concept to the mobilisation plan and other efforts in the OpenSSF: [Sterling Toolchain Concept](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z4YxuT6yzbgrNlUpgTbJhuKv5ngdsd6O8Dz5yRTepgs/edit#)
        * RFC from the TAC [https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/151](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/151) 
            * Though TAC is currently in transition from 2022 members to 2023 members (3 seats not yet filled)
        * Would b noe good to have some specificity about how Sterling Toolchain intersects (or doesn‚Äôt ) with FRSCA
        * Let‚Äôs schedule a follow-up in May as the concept crystalizes
    * 
* SIG Round-up
    * SLSA (esp. version 1.0)
        * On track for April 18th release
        * Comms out on April 19th 
        * Companies can begin publishing their own blogs April 26
        * Blog by Mike on Tracks
        * Upcoming blog on deep dive on bld vs src, 
    * S2C2F
        * [RSA](https://www.rsaconference.com/USA/agenda/session/Introducing%20the%20Secure%20Supply%20Chain%20Consumption%20Framework%20S2C2F)
        * OSSummit

    * Benjamin Schmidt, Cybersecurity Eng in MITRE
* WG Leadership
    * Update the [README](https://github.com/ossf/wg-supply-chain-integrity#governance) in the openssf GitHub, currently shows Kim & Dan as WG leads 
    * Dan stepped down when he joined the TAC; Kim stepped back from the meeting several months ago
    * What‚Äôs the process for naming new/additional chairs?
    * (Joshua) Isaac has been facilitating meetings and driving 2023 vision, seems a strong candidate for WG chair
    * OpenSSF requires two chairs, nominating chairs is a simple WG vote with notification to the TAC
        * https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/working-group-lifecycle.md
    * This WG‚Äôs repo has [governance](https://github.com/ossf/wg-supply-chain-integrity/tree/main/governance) doc which states only ‚ÄúTODO‚Äù
    * Proposal: Isaac as chair, Jay and Melba as co-chairs
        * No recorded objections in the meeting
    * Making it so: a PR on the README ([done, 3/15](https://github.com/ossf/wg-supply-chain-integrity/pull/56)), with thumbs up from stakeholders in this team
        * Note that there were no objections today

    * Been incorporating comments, updating document, clarifying wording
    * Most comments to date have been clarification round the edges, not on the substance 
    * Question for the group: is there a shared sense that the overall direction is ~right?
    * SCI Positioning group post-dates this document
        * Original framing of positioning group: ‚ÄúThe relationship between adjacent technologies, frameworks, and methodologies in the SCI space is clear with appropriate cross-links established"
        * Possibly there‚Äôs a chance to incorporate new structure we have into 2023 priorities
        * Question about whether SCI Positioning is a WG or a SIG or a Project‚Ä¶ possibly it needs to be a SIG, in line with OpenSSF uber-structure
        * Updated/Commented on SIG naming change on the top of the meeting notes
    * Opportunity to adjust meeting cadence and schedule
        * This group (SCI WG) might instead meet bi-weekly rather than monthly
    * Next steps:
        * Isaac to continue to incorporate feedback on the doc
        * Isaac to add some detail on role of SCI Positioning (and tag Melba/Jay)
        * We‚Äôll move this forum to bi-weekly (_done 3/15 by _[Melba.Lopez@ibm.com](mailto:Melba.Lopez@ibm.com)) and use it to land on a final doc we all nod along with
* SLSA Update
    * 1.0 RC Is out and open for comments
    * See #sci-positioning Slack channel for recent updates
    * **Very** interesting results from last year‚Äôs SLSA survey

* S2C2F Update
    * Training modules under development
        * Eight hours total, in various blocks
    * Useful input from David W will likely be incorporated into the framework itself
    * Presentation to RSA is confirmed üôå
* FRSCA Update
    * FRSCA is looking for more contributors/maintainers. Many of the current contributors and maintainers have either permanently or temporarily moved onto other priorities.
    * Could do with some more hands-on contribution and leadership/stewardship of the vision
    * Note that we have a FRSCA presentation in Vancouver in May @ Open Source Summit NA
    * FRSCA has huge potential as an e2e reference implementation of SCI practices and tools; could help with comprehension and ultimately adoption
        * Securing the pipeline definition
        * Secure the orchestration
        * Secure the build execution itself
    * [mlieberman85@gmail.com](mailto:mlieberman85@gmail.com) has been writing a doc to frame FRSCA, where it is, its goals and ambitions. Will share with the group

TAC hasn‚Äôt made any decision at this time. It‚Äôs on a taxonomy of attacks, but of course you can map defenses to what you can defend.
    * MITRE has done some work, e.g., MITRE ATT&CK
    * See also [pbom.dev](http://pbom.dev), ‚ÄúOpen Software Supply Chain Attack Reference (OSC&R)‚Äù
    * OpenSSF Diagrammer‚Äôs Society [OSSF Diagrammers Society Meeting Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14i9v7WuQcLzWpvLe9B0sl-kf90JLwxNwrZkRXLWmEdQ/edit?pli=1)
    * [S2C2F - front portion](https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f/blob/main/specification/framework.md#common-oss-supply-chain-threats) has a list.  See: [https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/threats](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/threats)
    * [SLSA has a list too](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/threats) [https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/threats](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/threats)
    * Others have starting doing this, e.g., in-toto, CNCF.
    * David: These tend to be taxonomies of the attacks. I could imagine a taxonomy of the defenses, but that‚Äôs harder, and in the end we want to know what attackers are countered.
    * Take-away: Work with end user group. Encourage them to not re-invent the wheel unless needed.

    * Positioning upleveling?
        * Jay agreed to co-lead S2C2F
        * Mike (maybe) to co-lead FRSCA
        * Need to update charter- expansion of charter scope
        * Meetings renamed/slack channel renamed
        * David: If you change a WG charter, need to ask TAC to review/approve. As long as it‚Äôs reasonable they are generally happy, but the goal is to try to make it so the WGs don‚Äôt constantly bump into  each other.

Reminder to review and comment on [OpenSSF SCI WG 2023 ‚Äî¬†EXTERNAL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SuJHaCr89Ih6TFvAIH2WM5M4_MlXwM8mqHynUBuungE/edit)

    * Looking at what improvements we can make going into 2023
    * We can do a better job at drawing the joint picture across the various SIGs
    * We have a ‚Äúmissing middle‚Äù problem of insufficient structure and vision between the top-level OpenSSF direction and the work in individual SIGs
    * Single framework to provide standardization of Supply Chain Integrity (potential vision) in a scalable manner
        * Should also enable enterprise with this framework
        * Define scalable - all package ecosystems, distributions, etc
        * Framework would drive where the gaps are and who we need to reach out to

        * SLSA enables a scan of a binary to be strongly linked to a commit SHA
        * Current wave is about generation of provenance; next will be about consumption, e.g., policy decisioning and consumer risk assessments
        * Lots of opportunity to make security metadata actually *valuable* to various audiences

Agenda:



* Status of SLSA - will be covered tomorrow
    * Specification - 1.0 Project underway. Narrowing focus on build, levels 1-3 (4 TBD), there is a separate ‚Äúsource‚Äù track
    * Positioning - Dev Blog underway - will include move to 1.0, have noted some discrepancies while writing the blog & will report that back
    * Tooling - (No tooling meeting last week due to KubeCon). Update pending from Mike L
    * Unclear how well SLSA working group will be attended this week due to KubeCon
* Thoughts on slsa-positioning ‚áí sci-positioning (Isaac) - supply chain integrity positioning
    * Maybe move SLSA positioning group up to supply chain integrity WG overall, in particular, make sure SLSA & S2C2F & Frsca map into the problem space so it‚Äôs clear
    * It‚Äôs made more pressing by the welcome addition to S2C2F, need to make it clear to all
    * Jay: There needs to be a bridge conversation, so we discuss what each does/doesn‚Äôt do so they work together. We could bring them out as 2 parts of an overall specification.
    * David: I propose working to create 1 slide that presents how SLSA & S2C2F work together. We‚Äôll have to present it, let‚Äôs create it together.
    * Isaac: Agreed, maybe multiple people try to create that slide, then we compare & take the best ideas. Need a common conception/articulation on how they work together.
    * Jay: Melba created a diagram. We could overlay where SLSA sits, S2C2F sits.
    * Jay: 2 slides, figure + notes.
    * At least show SLSA & S2C2F, it‚Äôd be great to show other things too like Frsca.
    * Will try: Isaac, Melba, Jay - share in Slack within 2 weeks, discuss in a month.
* Status of s2c2f following adoption by this WG (Jay)
    * [https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f](https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f)
    * Had our first SIG meeting, finally got calendar fixed up so it should be correct.
    * May need to move some meetings due to holidays. Working on admin rights on m
    * We have made a few changes to the framework per some issues (brought from old repo)
    * Want to make sure repo looks proper, positioned as project under LF
    * Work done in the open
    * Come and help us! Be in meetings, comment, alleviate gaps, etc.
    * Already have a few organizations interested in adopting it.
    *  Other links:
        * [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/opensource/osssscframeworkguide](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/opensource/osssscframeworkguide)
        * [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/opensource](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/opensource)
    * David: Once SLSA & S2C2F become more mature & we have a clear explanation of how they work together, I intend to update the fundamentals‚Äô course to explain their top-level concepts & point people to more.
    * Jay: Maybe have an sci.dev? One tab to SLSA, another to S2C2F.
    * S2C2F next meeting Nov 1, 3pm US Eastern Time
* Calendaring (David)
    * LF is working on improved calendar tooling - we let other foundations be the guinea pigs. Plan to slowly roll it out, making sure it works better than what we‚Äôve been doing.
    * I haven‚Äôt used it seriously, but I understand it has significant improvements, e.g., tracks who was at meetings automatically (e.g., so we can make sure that we have multiple organizations involved)

Agenda:



* New faces:
    * Sarah Evens from Dell
    * Alan Miller from Bloomberg
* [Sarah Evans] Where does the group fit in with the signing workstream of Mobilization Plan?
    * SLSA, FRSCA in this group
    * Sigstore as an OpenSSF project
* [Kim L] OSS SSC Framework - Do we want to adopt?
    * Call for objections
    * **No explicit objections**, group agrees to adopt SSC
    * Next stop: TAC blessing
* [Kim L] Meeting cadence
    * Should we move to monthly? Most of the work is done in subgroups.
    * Isaac: when we adopt SSC there will be a flurry of work for WG
        * Also we might want to expand scope of SLSA ‚ÄúPositioning‚Äù SIG to cover SSC
            * Jay: hesitant, want to ensure each has equal vigor, might be crowded with SLSA well underway and SSC still gaining momentum. But further down the line look at a single effort
            * Isaac: yes; we need to show how things map at least. This is SLSA, this is SSC, this is FRSCA. We don‚Äôt have that yet.
            * Jay: yes, some sort of doc of how SLSA and SSC align and bridge together will be necessary
    * Mike: there has been some confusion on how to get engaged in supply chain. Is lack of topics because folks don‚Äôt know where to start? Folks working on projects and want to demo but don‚Äôt know where to go.
    * Jacques: feels like TAC responsibility to show what goes where and make clear policy of whether projects/efforts will be adopted. Less liberal than say CNCF.
    * Mike: CNCF is liberal but has a well-known lifecycle, info at the moment is unclear for folks coming to OpenSSF.
    * Decision: We‚Äôll change to monthly and we can always change back.
* [Mike L] FRSCA update
    * We have a logo!
    * Still poking at workload identity, hardware identity. 
    * Will be reaching out to Jay / SSC to see how FRSCA fits or maps into that framework.

* [Jay White] and [Adrian Diglio] presentation on Open Source Software Secure Supply Chain (SSC) Framework	
    * Aspirational end: becomes ISO standard (-1 developer focused, -2 consumer focused), complete in a way that‚Äôs continuously improved
    * First step: Contribute this to OpenSSF, work it through. Have already proposed to best practices WG. It can be home to one WG, but want multiple WGs involved in some way.
    * David: LF is an ISO PAS (Publicly Available Specification) submitter - if creating an ISO standard is the eventual goal, the LF has mechanisms to make that easy to process.
    * Adrian: We specifically chose the spec license to make it easy to send to ISO
    * Adrian Diglio then began discussion.
    * 8 different requirements, all based on specific supply chain threats. Sonatype [noted](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/state-of-the-software-supply-chain-2021) 650% increase in supply chain attacks in 2021. We have [links to the threats](https://github.com/microsoft/oss-ssc-framework/blob/main/specification/framework.md#common-oss-supply-chain-threats), then map the threats to requirements that mitigate the threats.
    * Various levels, e.g.
        * Level 2: Need to adopt approaches to patch faster than adversaries
        * Level 3: Added mechanisms to protect themselves against dependency confusion, etc.
        * Level 4: More aspirational. Intended for OSS you deem critical.
    * There‚Äôs a questionnaire for developers
    * There‚Äôs a mapping to other specifications, e.g., SLSA
    * [https://github.com/microsoft/oss-ssc-framework](https://github.com/microsoft/oss-ssc-framework)
    * David: There are some things that people would like to change, e.g., their definition of OSS. You‚Äôre open to changes, yes?
        * Absolutely! We want community feedback!
    * Is this applicable to organizations, or should I have a focus on a particular component/package/artifact? Or both?
        * Adrian Diglio: I imagine a future where an organization claims conformance to the framework at a particular level - some requirements are really leaning org-level, not just repo-level. E.g., disaster recovery.
    * Isaac Hepworth: The title of the document seems much broader than the actual specification today. Might the title be changed, e.g., ‚ÄúSecure ingestion framework‚Äù or something?
        * Jay White: We‚Äôre aspirational to bring it large. It starts with consumer-focus.
        * When you combine developer & consumer focus, you‚Äôre complete.
        * Obviously we could change the name, but we‚Äôd like to bring them together.
    * Jay White: Both SLSA & SSC can be developed in the open together. The conversations need to happen in the open.
    * Isaac Hepworth: I share your excitement. It‚Äôd be good to map out the domain so we understand where each fits in. Someone could be easily confused. I don‚Äôt object to bringing in SSC, but I want to make sure people understand how they work together. There‚Äôs also CNCF, etc. It‚Äôs incumbent on us to explain the problem domain & how these components work together to solve it.
    * Jacques Chester: I like SLSA‚Äôs limited/focused scope. There‚Äôs room for complementary methods/controls. I‚Äôd be happy to have an allied framework to allow SLSA to be what it is, instead of trying to make SLSA be all things to all people.
    * Who has contributed beyond Microsoft?
        * Some others have, many have been interested & had discussions
    * Kim L: Anything that improves supply chain security is great by me. I want to make sure things are clear.
    * Need to figure out how to work out SLSA/SSC relationship.
    * Michael Lieberman: Need to work out ‚Äúhow things work together‚Äù
    * David A. Wheeler: I did a mapping to the SLSA diagram of OpenSSF & non-OpenSSF activities; CRob has also tried to do some organizing.
    * Jay White: Jonathan Meadows (Citi, chair end users WG) has something that might help.
    * David A. Wheeler: Let‚Äôs not leave Microsoft endlessly hanging. Don‚Äôt need to vote TODAY, but need to decide if OpenSSF is accepting this, & if so which WG
    * Jay White: We‚Äôll also present to End user WG tomorrow. Maybe this is a ‚Äúbidding war‚Äù? :-)
    * Abhishek: I think SSC would be better in this WG, that‚Äôll help align SLSA & SSC together. We‚Äôre very excited about SSC.
    * Adrian Diglio: I lead the Microsoft Supply Chain Team. We ID the scenarios, then work with various partners to scope out the parts.
    * Michael L: That‚Äôs a concern for OpenSSF as well - how do we best self-organize?
    * Jay White: The sooner we get SSC into OpenSSF, the faster we can resolve how they work together.
    * <Most people seemed to be very positive about SSC.>

* [SLSA(-inspired) Survey](https://forms.gle/5n8FfUU5fxpsJi269) ([https://forms.gle/5n8FfUU5fxpsJi269](https://forms.gle/5n8FfUU5fxpsJi269)): Seeking constructive feedback and joint participation from organizations or individuals that want to jointly run the survey and present results (John Speed Meyers, jsmeyers@chainguard.dev)
    * Will describe motivation, mention questions, and proposed whitepaper
    * John Speed is looking for feedback and collaborators
    * Hoping to send out mid-June or July, keep it open for a month
    * Collect data, make it open (not the PII), turn into a whitepaper
    * Happy for this to be an OpenSSF effort or cross org

    * [Josh] TAC is working on something for wg structure etc but it‚Äôs not ready yet
        * (notes from Josh): Not exactly. The TAC is going to defer to the working groups to determine their own purpose and structure. What a WG wants to consider in scope is up to the working group. The TAC will only weigh in when necessary (hopefully that never happens)
        * The TAC is putting effort into better understanding how and when to accept project donations. This is partially documented here [https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/78](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/78) and will be a future TAC meeting topic

    * Slides -> [https://www.slideshare.net/BillBensing1/ploigos-how-it-works-and-whypdf](https://www.slideshare.net/BillBensing1/ploigos-how-it-works-and-whypdf) 
    * Demonstrate the automated governance feature of the upstream.
    * Would like to assess the community‚Äôs thoughts on this as an OpenSSF Project.
    * Learn more on this [43 min video](https://developers.redhat.com/devnation/tech-talks/security-compliance-auditing)
    * Want to cover the technical details on this call.
    * Focuses on ‚ÄúSOLID‚Äù
        * S - Single Responsibility
        * O - Open-Closed Principle
        * L - Liskov Substitution
        * I - Interface Segregation
        * D - Dependency Inversion
    * Ploigos step runner: It‚Äôs not like Tekton. It needs a CI tool (GitHub actions, Jenkins, etc.) to run it. It extends the underlying runner. It can unit test the logic (for example)
    * Problem: two different auditors might give different response
    * Instead, serializes process/results, signs it with sigstore rekor separately from its results, so that you have separate evidence that it was generated from this approach.
    * The evidence isn‚Äôt stored in rekor, it‚Äôs stored separately.
    * Serialized Material is key to externalized policy
    * David: (to be question): Can you talk about its potential relationship to Pyrsia, SLSA, Secure Software Factory, reproducible builds?
        * Not familiar with Pyrsia
            * [https://github.com/pyrsia/pyrsia](https://github.com/pyrsia/pyrsia) - ‚ÄúZero-Trust Decentralized Package Network‚Äù
        * SLSA: Needs evidence. Ploigos lets you collect the evidence to show that you meet certain SLSA requirements. E.g., validate that you have 2 people. Ploigos lets 
        * This can power secure software factory - that uses Tekton. Ploigos can work even when you aren‚Äôt using tekton
        * Reproducible builds: separates the RESULTS from the evidence of process. The results should reproduce, the evidence of running a specific process won‚Äôt reproduce (different time/datestamps) instead it provides evidence that process ran multiple times. Capture the config file with the what ploigos was running.
    * Jacques: I‚Äôd call this repeatable not reproducible, it‚Äôs not bit-for-bit reproducible
      
* [Kim - May 11] Adopt WG charter [template](https://github.com/ossf/project-template/blob/main/CHARTER.md) (10 min)

    * cue is a configuration language looks like JSON+stuff, lets us easily add added functionality, can output to yaml, from some of the developers of Borg
    * GitHub actions works well for smaller tasks, but as workflows get bit need something else
    * Key abilities: Ability to define security policies at multiple levels (where each complies with the broader level), validating versions of tools (valid version of Tekton, etc.), making the secure software factory eventually pluggable (eventually!), using cue to configure things makes it easier - ‚Äúwhile deploying Tekton, ensuring Tekton policies are linked (in)‚Äù

* Syft demo - SBOM generation ask from the last meeting (Alex Goodman from Anchore)
    * [https://github.com/anchore/syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) (Apache 2.0 license)
    * Analyzes containers & filesystems to generate SBOMs in SPDX & CycloneDX & its own format.
    * It creates probable CPE names as ‚Äúbest guesses‚Äù,  Directly supports Grype (vulnerability matcher). Might be better to have *separate* process for CPE guessing.
    * David A. Wheeler:  The OpenSSF Best Practices badge uses repo URLs and home page URLs to identify packages; we *record* CPEs when available, but URLs are much better for identification. SWIDs don‚Äôt work for this use case; they‚Äôre based on hashes, & can‚Äôt work in this case because since a recompile often causes it to fail (no longer match when it should)
    * David A. Wheeler: I‚Äôve been trying get NVD to add home page URL, repo URL, maybe pURLs - many packages don‚Äôt have CPEs, but SWIDs can‚Äôt work in this use case. I have proposed version ranges for pURL.
* Josh: PURL has a proposal for version ranges [https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/pull/139](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/pull/139)
    * Moshe: 
        * PCE/pURL/SWID are not tackling the dependency-inheritance issue.
        * Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is an interesting effort by NIST to stitch together many formats and processes in a consistent and processable manner - https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol/
* Supply chain artifact signing (Kay Williams)
    * Context:
        * Microsoft and industry partners have been contemplating approaches to signing digital artifacts including SBOMs, containers, Digital Media metadata, IoT artifacts, etc. We would like to sync with others in this WG to see if there is interest in collaborating on an overall approach for digital artifact signing. In particular, we have a near term need to establish an approach for signing SBOMs, containers, and [C2PA](https://c2pa.org/public-draft/) artifacts.
    * Goal: Supply chain participants across the industry can validate the authenticity and integrity of digital artifacts
        * Digital artifacts: code, packages, containers, attestations (including SBOMs), and policy
        * Authenticity: was the artifact provided by the expected entity?
        * Integrity: was the artifact altered between the time it was provided and the time it was received?
    * Problem: Multiplicity of signing formats impedes validation of authenticity and integrity
        * Producers and consumers must provide/validate artifacts in an array of formats.
    * Goal for this WG:
        * Develop recommendations to facilitate authenticity and integrity validation
        * Solutions might include one or more of the following:
            * Agreeing on a standard format for signing digital artifacts
            * Creating tooling to assist with signing and validation artifacts across a variety of formats
    * Next Steps?
        * Establish a subgroup for discussion (Kay/Ian)
        * Subgroup to create proposal outlining requirements, alternatives
        * Subgroup to bring proposal back to full WG for discussion
    * Santiago: Updated WG README might help capture
    * Michael: I‚Äôd rather this group be an authoritative voice to develop the answer, e.g., where the government can come to. Can‚Äôt create results overnight.
    * (General agreement, create a subgroup to work this.)
    * Wheeler: Probably should first create a quick summary / links to existing formats (clearly document existing space, e.g., GPG), make sure it‚Äôs clear what the problem is, make sure we understand how existing projects (esp. sigstore) connects
* New meeting time to accommodate new members (due to WG scope change) (Kay Williams)
    * Check the OpenSSF calendar for possible times that don‚Äôt conflict with existing meetings?
    * Send a poll to the mailing list?

        * Disabling ‚Äúrun on install‚Äù by default
            * Some specific actions could be allowed if they‚Äôre known-safe, to make this practical.
        * Making the secure way the easy way
        * Convincing people to stop doing installs with ‚Äúcurl http://some_thing | sh‚Äù
            * Companies could say ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt use it then‚Äù
            * However, that probably won‚Äôt affect behavior
            * Nix tools sandbox it all, so none of those things should affect parent environment
        * Jacques: This paper has been very influential at Shopify, thank you.
            * Repos have a centralizing position, so you don‚Äôt need a denylist... you can just remove the package.
            * E.g., kix npm package.
            * Wielding that central authority is often something to be avoided much of the time, though. Needs to be confident that the result is correct.
        * Discussion of centralization vs. decentralization
            * I wouldn‚Äôt want to be in a situation where someone can remove a package & take down my system‚Äù‚Äú

* Rename WG from Digital Identity to Supply Chain Integrity (Kim/Kay)
    * Most in WG are supportive
    * TAC is supportive (see previous TAC meeting)
    * DECISION: We will rename! New name ‚ÄúSupply Chain Integrity WG‚Äù.
* Move the biweekly meeting earlier by 1 hour (8 AM Pacific)? (Kay)
* [Adolfo Garc√≠a Veytia](mailto:adolfo.garcia@uservers.net) present on SBOM generation tool for Kubernetes
    * Built a tool to produce SBOMs (in SPDX format) for Kubernetes (k8s)
    * URL of tool:
        * [https://github.com/kubernetes/release/tree/master/cmd/bom](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/tree/master/cmd/bom)
        * Eventually it may split out, but that‚Äôs where it is for now
    * Input formats it can handle:
    * Kay: Would this be better in OpenSSF or SPDX projects? I can see it‚Äôd be useful to have more general SBOM tooling in OpenSSF. Microsoft has some tools internally, too. There‚Äôs also a dependency tree generator that‚Äôs been used. Perhaps this WG is a good place to put SBOM generators, etc.
    * Adolpho: We‚Äôve been in talks with LF SDPX teams. They already have an SBOM generator, looking for community maintenance. Perhaps the two projects could be fused. E.g., we only handle go. They have support for other languages. They were also concerned about creating an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù SPDX tool, because that could be seen as the single tool & interfere with the development of other tools. One suggestion was to move it to OpenSSF. ([ACT](https://automatecompliance.org/) tooling as well.)
    * Overall issue: Where do SBOM tools go? Currently lots of people are working on them.
    * We want people to have a BOM, and we want that to be easy.
    * Abhishek: We also don‚Äôt want to reinvent the wheel.
    * Matt R: We should have tools do better than minimum.
    * Kim: Also, where are the BOMs stored? Exchanged? How are they supposed to be consumed?
    * [https://github.com/awesomeSBOM/awesome-sbom](https://github.com/awesomeSBOM/awesome-sbom) has list of tools
    * [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KT5QPCgVx_8UFIKv8-0k9GYjfcL3uvHmK4COOEGq_UQ/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KT5QPCgVx_8UFIKv8-0k9GYjfcL3uvHmK4COOEGq_UQ/edit#) - Aeva Black, ‚ÄúAn Analysis of the SSC Landscape‚Äù
    * David to figure out location/home for SBOM tools, should they live in ACT or in OpenSSF. And in OpenSSF, it is easy to develop in a community (Josh).

* [David] quick preso on yubikeys! / Multi-factor authentication (MFA) token use
    * David: I have to leave in a few minutes, I‚Äôm giving a presentation at a NIST workshop
    * Hot off the press: OpenSSF has been offered a large number of Yubikeys to distribute to OSS developers
    * We need to work out:
        * Who to distribute keys to
        * How to distribute (we need to give them confidence they‚Äôre not subverted!)
        * EASY to apply guidelines/tutorials/best practices for using them in common uses for OSS. E.g., ((commit to GitHub|GitLab|?)|(release package on repo)) using my platform (Ubuntu|Fedora|MacOS|Windows)
    * Propose working this as a task within the best practices WG & using its mailing list [is that unreasonable?]], but we really need to coordinate with:
        * the Digital Identity Attestation WG (hi!) [to ensure we get confidence] AND
        * Critical projects WG (ID some projects we really want to use tokens)
    * Suggestions on how to take next steps?
        * Maybe create a Google doc for a plan, assign parts, start executing

* Interesting survey about signing: ‚ÄúThe state of package signing across package managers‚Äù by Tieg Zaharia, June 11, 2020,  [https://blog.tidelift.com/the-state-of-package-signing-across-package-managers](https://blog.tidelift.com/the-state-of-package-signing-across-package-managers)
    * E.g., for some package managers there‚Äôs an API to determine whether or not there is 2FA. If there‚Äôs no API, we just have to take people‚Äôs word for it (not great)
    * ?: Maven/Java has signatures, but it‚Äôs hard to do, so it typically doesn‚Äôt happen. This report makes things seem rosier than it really is.
    * ‚ÄúThe gap between what‚Äôs done & what‚Äôs possible is very large‚Äù
* WG goals/targets open discussion - Gavin
    * We had[ previously identified areas ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gixyDvA0DppCDGhgzmTDxIADry7KTvldqdYO0oad2V8/edit)in the supply chain where Identity is relevant and some threat models where do we want to proceed from there?
    * Potential (non-exhaustive) Options:
        * Identify tool-agnostic minimum best-practices for each stage (the kinds of thing, not specific solutions)
            * Add to badging/scorecard projects?
                * CII Best Practices badge already has a signed release requirement at ‚ÄúSilver‚Äù - not at ‚Äúpassing‚Äù level because of its challenges - see [https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/criteria/1?details=true&rationale=true#1.signed_releases](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/criteria/1?details=true&rationale=true#1.signed_releases)
                    * It would be great if there was a paper that said ‚Äúhere‚Äôs recommended practices on how you do it‚Äù that others could point to (that paper could point to others)
                    * Recommended tools should be public OSS projects under neutral governance.
            * Whitepapers?
        * What‚Äôs the relationship between this WG and [SLSA](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa)? Is this the right WG for SLSA?
        * Recommended practices, perhaps including tools for each stage
            * Example identity tool chains?
            * Badging?
            * Whitepapers?
        * David A. Wheeler: No matter what, when writing criteria (requirements), it‚Äôs good to:
            * Write higher-level criteria that aren‚Äôt locked to specific tools
            * Provide rationales for each (WHY is that requirement there)
            * Provide guidance (suggestions on how to implement it for common cases.
        * For either/both, what recent/prominent supply-chain attacks might have been prevented?  Solar Winds?  PHP? Etc.
        * Others?
    * Note: per the README, we do not require revelation of real names. We also don‚Äôt want to _require_ revelation of other sensitive information (location).
    * Stephen Lauck: There‚Äôs really no way around the problem that there‚Äôs NO articulated policy of ‚Äúwhat you‚Äôre using‚Äù in Dockerfiles, etc. People are asking for transitive trust, but there‚Äôs no way to get that information. There needs to be a way to declare what you use. Transitive closure is hard
    * How much overlap between projects/efforts is okay?
    * We could investigate how many SLSA requirements can be transitioned to the CII Best Practices badge. It might not be all of them, but it might be helpful

    * Containers are the next major virtualization stack, providing an easy means to build a deployment package that encompasses your code, binaries and dependencies. How do you know the container image you're deploying was built by a vendor, or even a team you trust? Notary v2 aims to solve this problem by enabling signing of all artifacts placed in an OCI conformant registry. As the artifact is promoted within and across registries, Notary v2 signatures can move with the artifacts, enabling secure validations, ensuring the content you deploy is the content you trust.

Agenda:

	



* Damien Miller (Google) presented on ‚Äú[Git Signing with SSH](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aO-NtzCBbE3bz-tP7xFFKSXiSyLe8R0ytyLqK60n_G8/edit#slide=id.g1454b8b973_1_26)‚Äù - a proposal about supply chain attribution to make it possible to attribute something back to its author. Ideally back to a hardware root of trust. Some points:
    * GPG signatures supported, but rarely used. GPG/PGP is famously hard to use, no trivial way to link GPG ID with repo ID. Another problem is to preserve attribution over common changes.
    * Proposal: Add support for SSH signatures to git (as a peer to GPG). Most developers already use SSH with git, already have some familiarity with this.
    * Steps already taken:
        * In 2019, added to OpenSSH 8.1 a signature mode (SSHSIG). Retains ssh‚Äôs simple trust model, authorized_keys-like map between IDs and keys.
        * OpenSSH has long supported PKCS #11 but they‚Äôre fiddly & expensive. Early this year added support for U2F/FIDO, which splits key into hardware part & rest part, which is MUCH cheaper. <$10 to get a FIDO key
    * Some work happened since in git, but didn‚Äôt complete & go upstream - believe they ran out of time before it really completed. No objection from git developers in principle.
    * How can someone find a mapping between keys & iDs? GitHub as an API for querying this, the mapping can also be included in repo itself (so ‚Äúgit clone‚Äù can use it immediately)
    * Wider story of crypto & git: Some mutating operations destroy signatures (e.g., rollup commits).
    * What about expiration/revocation?
        * Revoking keys should be easy.
        * The system supports certificates which supports lifecycle control (e.g,. Timeframes allowed)
    * Damien will provide POCs to David Wheeler, who will try to contact those who partly implemented the next step to see what can be done next

Agenda



* [Konstantin Ryabitsev] presentation for linux development (confirmed)
    * Presentation on LInux kernel developer identity verification from Konstantin:

        [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ouNX0MQc5PH9YozoTHkpYFu1ANZFW24gDwy7RcIGFQM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ouNX0MQc5PH9YozoTHkpYFu1ANZFW24gDwy7RcIGFQM/edit?usp=sharing) 

    * Many maintainers choose to use ‚Äútrust on first use‚Äù (TOFU)
    * ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in my keyring, I trust your signature‚Äù
    * Upside: Scales better, easier to understand compared to web of trust (WoT)
    * There is a kernel.org web of trust, it‚Äôs everyone with an account on kernel.org. [https://korg.docs.kernel.org/pgpkeys.html](https://korg.docs.kernel.org/pgpkeys.html) - effectively this is my web of trust
    * Visualization: [https://www.archlinux.org/master-keys/#visualization](https://www.archlinux.org/master-keys/#visualization)
    * ‚ÄúPGP isn‚Äôt hard because it‚Äôs PGP. It‚Äôs hard because delegated trust is hard. The problem is less with tools & more with the problem itself. It‚Äôs true that PGP‚Äôs CLI‚Äôs is complex. It‚Äôs gotten better, and they really need more funding.‚Äù
* Any other presentation ideas for future meetings?
    * KR: I can suggest we talk to David Huseby of Hyperledger, who is working on did:git (distributed identity and signing with git, as alternative to PGP): [https://github.com/dhuseby/did-git-spec](https://github.com/dhuseby/did-git-spec)
* Follow-ups from Last time:
    * [Kay Williams] Collaboration with CDF security sig (confirmed)
        * CDF sec sig 3T sbom
        * [https://www.it-cisq.org/software-bill-of-materials/index.htm](https://www.it-cisq.org/software-bill-of-materials/index.htm)
    * [Dan Lorenc/Luke Hinds] - Scope discussions with TAC pending. For now, assume we can expand scope.
        * Next steps is to put together a simple doc outlining the scope and present to TAC
* Plan for [threat models doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gixyDvA0DppCDGhgzmTDxIADry7KTvldqdYO0oad2V8/edit#):
    * Collect all threat models in the supply chain integrity space in the document
    * Review threat models to decide which are in scope and which are believable
    * Collect prior art/discuss how existing projects mitigate these threats
    * Prioritize/split into themes and start addressing them!
        * What should be in scope for addressing threats? We can:
            * publish documents, best practices, guides
            * Build tools
            * Operate services?

Agenda:



* Intros (Name, Organization, Location)
    * Why are you interested in this topic?
* Logistics
    * Meeting cadence, time?
        * every other week at this time (16:00UTC, 9am PST)?
        * timezones?
        * Rotation to an Asia-friendly timezone once a month or so?
        * Decision: start with every other week, same time for now
    * Zoom/Hangouts/etc.?
        * Luke is happy to use hangouts
        * Matt says Teams is better than Zoom, maybe hangouts is too
        * Should we record these?
            * Yes, and remind people every time
    * GitHub Repo: [https://github.com/ossf/wg-developer-identity](https://github.com/ossf/wg-developer-identity)
* Scope of WG
    * Kay Williams: [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_9jZSQLzoeqD8cgYMiRWRSdI7O5P1wJwdRjlXBKErUU/edit?usp=sharing) is a document for discussion. This is a rather large scope expansion, aimed at first laying the groundwork for supply chain attestation and policy, and later building from it to support attestation and policy around developer identity (and other aspects of supply chain security and compliance)
    * Luke: Agrees with everything in here. It's a lot wider, not sure this is a bad thing
    * Joshua - not sure there is a place where the overall topic is being discussed, let's just expand the scope here
    * Luke - Identity could still be an inroad to this, start with this as a first goal
    * David - if we do expand, we do still need to pick a few areas to focus on
    * Sridar - pick a few goals to build an MVP 
    * Ivan - For people not familiar with OSSF, what other WGs are there? is there overlap?
        * [https://github.com/ossf/tac](https://github.com/ossf/tac)
        * Is there a community-wide meeting for the entire foundation? Could we check scopes then?
    * Luke - TAC meeting provides oversight for these
        * First TAC meeting Friday at Noon
        * David - scope changes could be discussed then!
    * Matt Thompson - reference to things like keybase.io stuck in his mind, enabling people to identify themselves in a secure fashion
        * Maybe this is just a facet
    * Andrew Martin - other organizations in this space
        * sig-security-supply-chain in CDF
        * SBOM working groups
        * David - if we decide to broaden scope we'll need to work with these other organizations
    * Matt - are we verifying companies or individuals?
        * Luke - yeah this is a topic we're tackling here, it's harder in open source than at a private organization. Risk could be involved for people to work under real names. Need to balance these concerns.
        * David - privacy is very important, this is a large concern
            * Could look at this as supplier identity (could be real name, or pseudonym, or organization)
        * Dan - other threat models to verify two identities are unique
            * David - very tricky
    * Luke - good we have people from in-toto here
        * Bad things do happen. Do we have some ways to verify/log all things that have happened later. Tamper proof record
* Next Steps
    * Start with Threat Models
        * David - stronger confidence that releases were done by the same organization/individual as the last one
            * Bitcoin - we still don't know who Satoshi Nakamoto is, but we can verify if that person made a change
            * Axel - actually we don't know, we just know it was signed by the same key. Could be multiple people
            * Matt - we have keys as identifiers
            * David - keys aren't perfect but are a good first step, the next step of associating keys to suppliers (organizations, pseudonyms, and real people) would be fabulous. Maybe we can split it into those 2 different problems (so we can work on them separately)
        * List of case studies. eg. Linux
* From github repo:
    * Malicious/Nefarious individuals get maintainer permissions and starts making making commits or pushes to a registry
        * Making it more obvious that a different individual is involved could help recipients know there might be a higher risk
    * Duplicate accounts, self-reviewing code
    * Identity spoofing: claiming you work for a specific organization that you do not, or are a specific individual that you are not
        * Konstantin - would case studies be helpful?
            * Yes! He'll do a presentation on how this works in the linux kernel in a future meeting.
            * Linux has some things, not documented well, but they exist and are trying to address these things
        * Luke - different levels of projects, PyPi, NPM on one end, Golang on the other end
            * Varying levels of cryptographic guarantees
        * Luke - more hands on keyboards than powerpoints, should be able to find projects to try these techniques out in
        * David - subverted repo
            * People gained control of entire repos, verifying things in Repos. GitHub has had a few of these. It‚Äôs happened several times in the past. E.g., 2003? - Linux kernel repo was subverted
            * GitHub/GitLab have done great jobs here, but no one is perfect
            * also subverted package managers repos - credential compromise & package manager repo compromise
        * Srikanth - subresource integrity
            * CDNs distributing things are part of the supply chain
            * Golang module transparency in this space
                * Also Brandon Phillips‚Äô new project [https://www.transparencylog.com/](https://www.transparencylog.com/)
        * Andrew Martin - typo squatting
            * #1 supply chain problem right now (David can you link this?)
                * In Sonatype report
                * [Ohm 2020] Ohm, Marc, Henrik Plate, Arnold Sykosch, and Michael Meier, ‚ÄúBackstabber‚Äôs Knife Collection: A Review of Open Source Software Supply Chain Attacks‚Äù, 2020-05-19, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09535](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09535)
            * This could be viewed as verifying the identity of the _package_ instead of verify the identity of the supplier
        * Axel - another issue: ‚Äúnot another account/set of credentials!‚Äù
            * One account to do everything (fedora has SSO)
            * Self-sovereign identity/decentralized identity
        * Joshua - need to keep in mind the amount of effort required to use these. If it's too hard no one will use it.
            * TUF integration into PyPI was scaled back because developers didn‚Äôt want another secret to remember (see initial proposal in [PEP 480](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0480/) vs [PEP 458](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0458/), which is being implemented now)
            * Repository signed on upload
            * Must make it EASY to use
            * Make it a carrot instead of a stick (provide an advantage/incentive)
            * Andrew - ingestion of OSS into regulated environments is a nightmare. This could help as a carrot
    * Next steps:
        * Dump all this into a doc and start having people contribute threat models. We can then curate, combine, agree
            * [Dan to send out this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gixyDvA0DppCDGhgzmTDxIADry7KTvldqdYO0oad2V8/edit#)
            * CNCF sig security has an attack catalog [https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/tree/master/supply-chain-security/compromises](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/tree/master/supply-chain-security/compromises) and [https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/blob/e6dfeb2f767b36c747831850e2a3fdf4f9c26aea/supply-chain-security/compromises/compromise-definitions.md](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/blob/e6dfeb2f767b36c747831850e2a3fdf4f9c26aea/supply-chain-security/compromises/compromise-definitions.md)
        * Luke Hinds and Dan Lorenc to discuss scope at TAC meeting Friday
        * All: review [Kay‚Äôs document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_9jZSQLzoeqD8cgYMiRWRSdI7O5P1wJwdRjlXBKErUU/edit#heading=h.23hd1ivmr3lp)
