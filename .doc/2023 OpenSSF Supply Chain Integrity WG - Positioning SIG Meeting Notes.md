* Topics to think about as we get into 2024:
* GUAC
* Lots of activity going on, we need to start thinking about what we are going to do to promote it
* SLSA?
* Arnaud: work has started on several fronts: build level 4, source track, and dependency track although the latter isn’t really active. Things are moving slowly, don’t think it needs to be on our radar for now.
* Jay: S2C2F ought to be talked about when it comes to the dependency track. We ought to have a more comprehensive approach to how we develop these standards.
* S2C2F
* Jay: Looking at a way to get it on an official standards track, maybe through JDF. Wonder what the process is for OpenSSF to make such a submission, possibly with both SLSA and S2C2F.
* Arnaud: don’t know, would need to raise an issue with the TAC to get this discussed
* Gituf
* We need to know more about what’s going on on that front.
* Supply Chain Security Conference @ OSS NA 2024 - Seattle, WA April 16-18
* Jay is the chair
* CFP going out “this week”, will be at: https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/program/cfp/
* CFP closes on January 14, 2024
* We need to talk about what presentations and panels we want to plan for
* Given the short timeline we are working against we will need to focus the next few meetings we have before the holidays to that.

* Welcome to new folks!!
* Chris Lamb, from reproducible builds; lurking :) 
* John Kjell - hope to attend more often - conflicts with sbom dhs meetings
* [Mike Lieberman] More SLSA feedback + SLSA webinars/training
* Love to have a webinar that starts with … container/java app, here’s how i build it using SLSA in the larger picture.  
* Tools are being built out, so need to make the community aware
* Webinar can be with existing tools to just show a POC
* LF looking to help expand in webinars and training
* GitHub Issues
* [https://github.com/ossf/wg-supply-chain-integrity/issues/63](https://github.com/ossf/wg-supply-chain-integrity/issues/63)
* 2b. MVSLSA? Minimum Viable SLSA? --> github actions? + npm ecosystem support
* maven & python support is coming ***when is the timeline***
* what SLSA level should we aim for? aim for signed provenance
* common slsa practices for verification (i.e. slsa rebuilder)
* did this build come from the right party claiming to be doing the right thing
* tooling needs to be able to have a SLSA level higher than the developer access.
* Positioning/SLSA meeting for actual Hands on Keyboard to go through a scenario.  
* SLSA bite size - L1 then L2, L3 (could use GH to demonstrate L3)
* Should we do workshops with the community????? 
* CARVE OUT 15 mins from meetings to get people to come and ask questions
* need to ask SLSA specification folks about these webinars
* need some incentives 
* would love to do slsa but if its not part of my core responsibility/competency, i can't implement myself
* can we have someone funded by LF/OpenSSF to generate the content? -> melba to reach out to jennifer
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDL24--bqnM <-- beginner to slsa video from OSSNA
* @jkjell Then we get into the fun conversations about the definition of a “trusted control plane” 😅 
* 3. How do i get started (Advanced)? 
* 3a. Getting your build to meet the requirements of SLSA (maybe 1.5 hour webinar)
* 3b. How to hit the isolation requirements _(existing build tools not created to protect themselves from each other)_
* 3c. End to end how to build a SLSA builder from scratch
* 3d. how does SLSA protect you?
* @jkjell slsa provenance has been harder; what does this field (in provenance) mean and how does it apply to our application
* @sudo-bmitch Both "isolated" and "unforgeable" fall into the hard category for folks that are used to building pipelines with access to signing secrets.

* Welcome to new folks!!
* Cassie crossley - schneider electric; working on software transparency (vp for supply chain security) / sbom; End User’s group - SBOM’s everywhere!
* S2C2F - cannot update in OT world (must backport)
* On a webinar with Adrian and met in RSA (jcdc meetings)
* [Mike Lieberman] SLSA marketing materials repo?
* There is still a lot of confusion around SLSA v1, and a lot of folks are still using content from SLSA v0.1/v0.2, e.g. [https://youtu.be/oPb7vIC0W9Y?t=2474](https://youtu.be/oPb7vIC0W9Y?t=2474)
* Folks are still giving presentations on v0.1/v0.2
* Repo in SLSA - pull things out of SLSA.dev into a collection; 
    * Could be 1 pager for diagrams or tables
    * Would help people with getting updated information/diagrams for presentations
* Basic materials for mission - SCI WG
* There will be a L4, source track, etc … how can we communicate what is or isnt part of V1.0
* Writing up a “branding guide” or FAQ? 
* We removed L4 and people are confused; we are not doing a good job on the marketing/education; LF is willing to help out here
    * BM: I suspect there will also be a Level 5 in the future, but I don't think we want to discuss things that don't exist yet. I'd focus on saying it was removed until it can be better defined.
* For new folks it can be confusing without the history
* [Mike Lieberman] APAC - I have been asked to work on a webinar for SLSA v1 for APAC. Might be worthwhile to standardize it and have a few webinars globally. I know we discussed this recently.
* Julian from LF for APAC (japan is separate) 
    * August webinars 
    * How do we “seed” the community in APAC
    * How do we get feedback from APAC community
    * Should we have webinars in the US? -> introductory, how it works, basic implementations
        * Talking to the community meetings understanding the status, where we are, or specific questions
        * Need where do i get started with SLSA
        * Office hours also may not be 
    * S2C2F - LF training modules; they asked for SLSA too.  Training modules for each track makes it more complex. - randall/tom/? J**_ay to provide the names :) _**
* Hard for groups to come up with content (volunteers)
    * MM: Micro videos sound good to me. I'm happy to help write up scripts for one of the videos, but also don't have editing experience. Wonder if we can engage with Jennifer Bly here?
    * Need to ask Jennifer how quick can we do micro videos (she may also know who to go to for video editing)
* Claudia - Ebook/real book ; what does the provenance, sbom, etc look like? And what do you do with it? Practical how to ; would like to help out with education/outreach! TY! 😀
    * [eBook link (ungated) is here](https://5262266.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5262266/Journey%20to%20a%20Secure%20Supply%20Chain%20eBook%20Chap%201-5.pdf)
* Maybe other topics that would help with background for people to understand SLSA? 
* Not many devops folks (at devops day in NYC) knew about Supply Chain Security , but they have heard about solar winds.  They have heard about SLSA, but not that it ties back to Supply chain.

* Positioning Meeting Time
* Proposal: Alternate with SCI WG Meeting time slot? +5 votes for this time :) 
* S2C2F Coverage Analysis vs SLSA vs frsca (started)
* June 6th Meeting - [https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C03THTh2RSM/p1686081687255649](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C03THTh2RSM/p1686081687255649) 
* Phase 2 - June 20th (review continued)
* SCI WG repo cleanup
* Issues/Branches
* Previous contributors (reach out to verify if anyone is a LF employee)
* [https://github.com/ossf/wg-supply-chain-integrity/pull/60](https://github.com/ossf/wg-supply-chain-integrity/pull/60) 
* Charter/Mission
* Isaac communicated to the TAC - [https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C01A1MA7A1K/p1686074149776839](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C01A1MA7A1K/p1686074149776839) 
* Isaac to provide update on the TAC’s comments
* TAC Issue # (jay or someone to add link later) 
* 1 page blog guidelines from Jay - (add to the SCI WG github repo)
* Next Phase:
* Adoption may fit in to positioning (short term) as we originally anticipated during the early SLSA positioning days
* What can we do to start driving that adoption now that S2C2F and SLSA is at 1.0
* No real tools on slsa 1.0 yet; little adoption on slsa 1.0
    * [https://github.com/oracle/macaron](https://github.com/oracle/macaron)
    * SLSA tools being developed by google but not being communicated to the tooling group causing confusion/double work
* Office hours (guac has this today) - demo and how the tools are actually being used; adopters/maintainers showing off a new feature
    * SCI WG meetings may be a good place? (isaac has been looking for more of this)
    * I.e. how to slsa-fy my jenkins
    * Drive message back to the TAC; some groups have funding and potentially we could leverage
    * Vendors are claiming SLSA compliance (conformance stuff could help)
    * No agenda for slsa tooling in the past 3 weeks; need engineers interested/focused on this
        * Can positioning group help drive the “this is not a meeting to ramble, but to code”
    * Tekton major backer of slsa (need more of this)
    * RedHat may be doing something around SLSA Attestation
    * Folks are asking for a larger suite of tools
    * [Seedwing](https://playground.seedwing.io/#) from redhat?? (link + demo)
    * Should we go back to the attack vectors and prove out slsa? 
    * Trust but Verify - even trusted entities
* Next Steps:
* Talk about trust of where the metadata came from (institutional trust) is not enough for security/trust in software (2-3 min video)
* Best Practices/Education/End User WG help advocate/evangelize SLSA and get feedback
* Webinar/Video Deep Dive for SLSA implementation
* Training modules with LF/SKF?; how do we submit for these?
* Track in GH Issues + Time Frames

* OSSNA - Hot Topics 
* Majority of feedback was good
* Need more examples around threat scenarios
* “run through” of how slsa would have been able to prevent/mitigate
* or items they should be looking for (i.e. compromised ci system)
* Confusions around SLSA levels versus versions versus tracks
* Colors, numbers, letters? For levels
* Maturity model, security framework, or a compliance requirement, or guidelines? If it's all 3? Need to provide detailed descriptions of each of these, so that consumers can understand what to expect or how to apply at each respective use case within their organizations. (Consider implication and impact at business unit, org, and enterprise levels)
* Need some additional help to sort out the wording/documentation to ensure non-engineers (more compliance focused) folks can understand the nuances
* Engineers need to consider SLSA as an AND vs OR; extra controls on top of WHEO/NIST/CISA/etc.
* Framing based on personas
* Deep dive talk went well - new npm beta was showcased
* How to get into team city or jenkins questions
* Get 3rd parties to come to SLSA to enable “slsa compliance” on their tools
* I wonder if there's a good way to abstract away the CI platform from the SLSA builder. Package the builder in a container that can run in any CI.- Brandon Mitchell
    * Mike L - working on an opensource project to provide an opportunity for any CI System to leverage
    * [FRSCA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fIj128ljSPVhFIViVX9b85iNQP8s-s0O6khOeXDgxlc/edit?usp=sharing) based on tekton; people want to run a plugin into their CI system vs using what FRSCA is today
        * Alot of folks looking at FRSCA
        * Maybe we can simplify frsca to pieces vs whole solution
        * Maybe we can push frsca to devops style conferences
        * Potentially write in go, rust, python to make it easier to run
* SCI Positioning not in David Wheelers diagram
* Has no landing page, no charter.  
* Melba -  copy over slsa charter to SCI WG repo
* Editing to expand coverage
* Melba - Create a folder in SCI WG Repo for positioning
* Adding a readme for Positioning Landing page
* Melba - Create a nested blog folder 
* Templates for SCI WG
* Need to update governance
* Update templates
* For Isaac’s 1 pager, guidelines should have clarity on what’s major
* What is a blog vs documentation?
* Jay - 1 pager to better communicate when blogs/announcements go out
* Guides to writing blogs as part of SCI (sub-groups included)
* When should you consult SCI positioning
* When its right to reference all 3 SIGs vs not
* Guest post vs community posts

* Welcome Newcomers!
* SLSA 1.0 Feedback
* Overall good feedback
* CNCF and others are interested in doing SLSA audits
* End user orgs are worried that SLSA requires them to stop doing what they’re currently doing and switch to SLSA
* Jay brings up a good point that it’s an “AND” not an “OR”. We need to communicate this better so they understand that they should keep doing what they’re doing.
* 
* SLSA bld vs. src blog - PR: [https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/pull/854](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/pull/854)
* A blog that talks about how adopting one thing doesn’t prevent you from adopting multiple things
* A lot of confusion around enterprise policy and governance, etc.
* We had discussed about talking about the mission of OpenSSF.
* Roadmap communication
* Brian - Communicate out the planned next 12-18 months.
* “Do-ocracy” - I like that. 
* Have a webinar around the roadmap

* Welcome Newcomers!
* Benjamin Schmidt - interested in supply chain security
* FRSCA needs help!!! Developers welcome! (tool centric SIG)
* Mike L. has a blog in play to explain FRSCA and solicit feedback/recruit for new devs
* Draft ready tomorrow (Please REVIEW!)
* 
* Principles to guide where we publish information: blogs vs. docs etc. (Isaac, 10 mins)
* What’s blog worthy vs core documentation?
* OpenSSF governance on blogs; people sidestep process by putting in doc vs blog
* What’s an OpenSSF Blog vs a project blog?
* Project blogs may  not have to go through TAC, except releases?
* Should not have Guidelines with a caveat that blogs can be posted elsewhere without TAC governance (1 way; not 1 way with multiple exceptions)
* 1) Guidelines for how to think about blog vs doc (what content belongs where)
* 2) Governance for who/where/how to post a blog (how does a review happen)
* We should probably go to the TAC to identify if we have the correct assumptions
* Guest blog vs official community blog post
* Announcements (i.e. 1.0)
* DO WGs have special rules vs SIGs
* Openssf blog vs slsa.dev 
* No official decision from TAC, but was discussed in TAC
* Isaac to put together a 1 pager
* Community to review (by EOD **TBD**)
* Community to contribute/review ( ) 
* RC2 blog may be coming out to “update” the community on the changes.
* Would like to have better coordination 
* Need to have a process that is documented to show when to engage the positioning group vs not (also related to the previous comment about openssf governance)

* Sigstore has their own process for their blogs; Cross collaborating with OpenSSF
* Should ask the TAC if they want to be consulted/review release blogs for clarity/extra detail on slsa.dev
* What constitutes as major announcement?
* As a group, we could notify the TAC but not necessarily approve (maybe post in [#tac](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C01AAV2TTEG)
* For Isaac’s 1 pager, guidelines should have clarity on what’s major
* What is a blog vs documentation?
* Jay - 1 pager to better communicate when blogs/announcements go out
* Guides to writing blogs as part of SCI (sub-groups included)
* When should you consult SCI positioning
* When its right to reference all 3 SIGs vs not
* Guest post vs community posts

* Welcome Newcomers!
* **Andres Vega** 😀 WELCOME!
* John Speed Meyers 😀
* Claudia Ring 😀
* Mike/Jay/Bruno - Update:
* 
* Specification - lots of comments still on definitions/restrictions/tracks
* Have we made slsa too easy? (misconception)
* Roadmap communication ([take roadmap we started )](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b3e7LWO2_kIuOoITtm9F7Wr5RsH8Iq1cxoPL2jmL0oA/edit#slide=id.g1e75a0c62aa_0_130)
* Trusting the spec when more tracks coming up and potentially impact previous “certifications”
* Tactical vs strategic
* What to expect between versions (minor vs major)
* Specific attack prevention/deterrence
* [SCI WG Mission/Scope ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SuJHaCr89Ih6TFvAIH2WM5M4_MlXwM8mqHynUBuungE/edit?resourcekey=0-wg-QROzZFa4Ju_uN_wOBNQ)
* Action items: 
* [SLSA 1.0 Comms Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gcx8PtWosO-C9wXUEHKBwWyt26NmeQ8q1uONku8Z5eo/edit), and core talking points development (Isaac, ?? mins)
* Comms may be first time an individual may have heard of SLSA
* Crystal clear on what SLSAslsa is (beginner like blog)
* Call to action for first timers
* SLSA is targeting build … so we can’t say supply chain integrity/security ; sboms also and need to articulate that
* Hope for toolset/infra to handle SLSA for us and not have to worry about it
* Coordinate with CISA on using SLSA [(cite their stuff)](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ESF_SECURING_THE_SOFTWARE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_DEVELOPERS.PDF)
* Jennifer Asks for the Group:
* People to write and describe what’s happening and why you should care
* Key themes/messaging
* Goals for each audience
* Jennifer can help with basics of distribution plan
* **EVERYONE ADD THINGS TO [SLSA 1.0 Comms Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gcx8PtWosO-C9wXUEHKBwWyt26NmeQ8q1uONku8Z5eo/edit),**
* SLSA++ survey results presentation (John Speed Meyers and Tracy Miranda, 10 minutes)
* Survey conducted last summer
* 167 respondents; 3 practices are from SLSA out of 10 (based on v0.1)
* ~30% or so have never heard of SLSA (last summer)
* Centralized build service 50% common
* Hermetic builds <25% common
* Relationship between any given practice is helpful or not vs adoption
* No relationship between Level of perceived difficulty and adoption 
* **Good news:  moderate to high adoption, practices are considered useful, some are hard but difficulty doesn’t appear to be a major impediment. **
* Provenance is a core idea of SLSA - needs to be a provenance everywhere campaign (3rd hardest to implement and less common practice)
* Can the team do a blog/pulse on how its perceived today?
* Quick pulse survey via OpenSSF?
* Reach a wide network via wider corporate participation?
* Check for SLSA badges against all the repos.
* Openssf Day CFP - Submit Ketchup, Relish, Mustard of Supply Chain Security **(DUE DATE FRIDAY)**

* **Joshua Lock** - _Hello! We are seeking feedback on the terms we use to define personas who implement the pieces of SLSA. We would greatly appreciate your input on the term "packaging ecosystem", please review and comment on this issue: [https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/issues/538](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/issues/538)_
* _Getting input from Best Practices WG on if they have this defined or working on the definition @SecurityCRob_
* 
* __A packaging ecosystem is a set of conventions and tooling for package distribution. Every package has an ecosystem, whether it is formal or ad-hoc. Some ecosystems are formal, such as language distribution (e.g. [Python/PyPA](https://www.pypa.io/)), operating system distribution (e.g. [Debian/Apt](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format)), or artifact distribution (e.g. [OCI](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec)). Other ecosystems are informal, such as a convention used within a company. Even ad-hoc distribution of software, such as through a link on a website, is considered an “ecosystem”.__
* _"(in general use) a complex network or interconnected system. -- "Silicon Valley's entrepreneurial ecosystem""_
* _Not a fan of ecosystem --- maybe something like toolkit - too nebulous and broad_
* _Security controls for an "ad-hoc" ecosystem may not exist or even be applied such as a formal ecosystem._
* _Company PoV on their formal ecosystem may not align with traditional ecosystem (Python/PyPA)._
* _Artifact repository = vendor solution; compliance meaning is different = evidence repository (given this is slsa and attestations, it could be confused with where you put evidence about attestations)_
* _can we simplify the picture? --> import, build, "distribute = new word"_
* _@camaleon2016 @brunodom @ jeff aboud_
* **Tracy Miranda -_<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>Hello, I'm not able to join the meeting but I wanted to highlight that I worked with the OpenSSF team on a landing page for Sigstore [https://openssf.org/community/sigstore/](https://openssf.org/community/sigstore/) and would be great if we could do one for SLSA - happy to help connect folks if you all can put together an outline_**
* _Consult with whomever created [https://slsa.dev/](https://slsa.dev/) _
* _Discuss in the Higher level SLSA Community Meeting - Dec 15th _

* (Isaac’s Suggestion) - [Microsoft’s OSS SSC](https://github.com/microsoft/oss-ssc-framework/blob/main/specification/Open_Source_Software_(OSS)_Secure_Supply_Chain_(SSC)_Framework.pdf). as SSC incubates in OpenSSF we’ll want to make it super-clear how it and SLSA fit together as a powerful cohesive whole
* Consumer based and consumer focused
* SLSA SIGs scopes have a lot of scope creep; alot of concerns can be addressed on the consumer side 
* SLSA is very producer based
* 2 frameworks can be bridged together 
* ISO Standards ~~NIST frameworks~~ could use a taxonomy of -1 (producer) -2 (consumer) -3(tooling)
* Msft already has a blog already on OSS SSC ; jay to work with adrian 
* Marcela - like the consumer vs producer positioning; the types of info that SSC would capture to get a better understanding on how it compliments slsa?
* Ingestion of OSS (slsa does not cover)
* Threats experienced at the consumer level
* Info that SSC conveys vs SLSA?
    * How you bring in OSS, scans, what are you using it for 
* Jay to maybe bring in Adrian to help clarify some questions (deep-dive)
* [Specification topic suggested for positioning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kMP62o3KI0IqjPRSNtUqADodBqpEL_wlL1PEOsl6u20/edit#heading=h.y41jhhrxegmf)
* _Emmy Eide, Joshua Mulliken, or Laura Seay [10 min]: Trademark SLSA? Licensing? Goes back to the “rejected topic” of Corroboration of security claims_
* _Potentially we could produce a set of badges that are specially licensed so that it can only be used if requirements are met. Organizations would have to sign some sort of “license agreement” to be able to use a badge_
* _That wouldn’t necessitate that independent audits occur but it would give legal power to revoke the badge if it was discovered that they were not fully complying_
* _In the absence of a badge that people can display, the SLSA brand will be diluted._
* _Should be moved to Positioning meeting._
* Linux Foundation already doing this 
* Kim to do a demo on the SLSA meeting
* SLSA may be trademarked
* Conformance program (self; 3rd party accreditation) 
    * Jason is working with Kim on the conformance program
    * Current status? Not seeing github issues–where is it? Want to make sure it's out in the open.  
    * Josh would like to help with review
    * Jason to work Mike to get it in github
* How do you engage Linux Foundation to report badge misuse
    * Mike/Jason to see if there are Lawyers that can give an overview (15 min) in the next meeting (reach out to Kim/Jason)
* SLSA Webpage/Blog to state not ready to do slsa 4, etc. to inform the public
    * Where? (write a blog)
    * Who? (maybe anyone from SLSA community)
    * When? (after lawyer discussion)
* SLSA TAC Update
* OpenSSF blog - need review by TAC
* SLSA blog - does not need to be reviewed by the TAC
* Google Groups/Lists → need to migrate to Groups.io _“<code>"Please note that we use Groups.io for mailing list support and will need to migrate the project to this forum by the end of the year."</code></em>
* <code><em>Research instructions/etc.  </em></code>

* Continuous compliance  - SLSA Does not have a loop back at the moment 
    * Should SLSA have a feedback loop for supply chain integrity??
    * PyPi example — if there’s no loopback you don’t know (Jeff)
    * Roy - Trust in a product requires a malware scan every two weeks
    * Jeff - trust is not a 1 and done – have to continuously check that source (pypi or any repository)
    * If Publish VEX in the OSS ; how do you deal with product response to that VEX – not linked to product (claim independent of slsa? Openssl library–rebuild?? –nebulous  (roy)
        3. Hybrid scenario in the specification?? 
* Design Considerations 
    * Do we go more towards in-toto ? slsa is more about here are claims and here’s evidence (pull side)

* Melba - How do we use this with the google spreadsheet we have today? (mike to help) 
* Jay - if we use oscal, if new controls get implemented, does it change in one place and the automation that you have in place also points to that change?
* Mike - conceptually; may have some manual things you would have to change 
* Jay - could help with not overusing tooling and refocusing efforts elsewhere
* Melba - any business using this actively? (mike - yes knows a few)
* Mike - jon has been looking at OSCAL  for the CNCF ; will reach out

* Brandon - should evangelize/educate part of adoption?
* Mike - adoption is split up within each 
* Brandon - lets be more intentional on adoption 
* Jay - is it any tooling for SLSA? Scoping of adoption sig vs evangelize?

* Change “Signing” to “Cryptographic Signing” (this isn’t wet signatures nor DCO)
* Change “Binaries” to “Packages”
* In Add Key
    * “Process (not phase)”
    * Persona
* David: In general we need to focus on processes not phases - everyone has different phases, it’s hard to unify, let’s focus on processes instead (like ISO does) that all just happen in parallel.
* ?: Assume that OSS projects don’t have legal teams.
* David: Don’t assume that. We (LF) absolutely have lawyers to deal with legal questions. And small businesses that generate proprietary software often don’t have in-house lawyers. Let’s just identify what needs doing, and the important personas that may exist… even if they don’t exist in some specific cases. If you do that, you cover the key points.

* Melba Lopez (IBM) - Excited to get this SIG kicked off! :) 
* Jay White (Microsoft)
* Isaac Hepworth (Google) — slowly recovering from Covid :)
* Mike Lieberman (Kusari, CNCF Supply chain WG)
* Jason Lutz (Chainguard)
* Marina Moore (Chainguard/NYU) - Interested in possible collaboration with CNCF Supply chain WG
* Jeff Aboud (ActiveState) - definitely happy to be part of this community!
* Roy Williams (Microsoft)
* Parth Patel (Kusari)

**Agenda:**



* Collaboration model
* Biweekly still works (Jason Lutz) 
* Slack or other mediums for asynchronous discussions
* Slack +1 by several members (isaac hepworth, michael lieberman, 
* Discussion mailing list - mostly being used for announcements at this time.
* What can we do to better coordinate —- Layout working principles - keep an eye on new standards as they come up (incorporate into slack/discussion groups); how we make decisions/prioritize; lets help people understand whats slsa
* +1 Melba
* Scope and Charter
* Potential draft: “The relationship between SLSA and adjacent technologies, frameworks, and methodologies is clear with appropriate cross-links established.” 
* Get alignment on what this group is about [(maybe Mark/Josh proposal has this??) ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L1gEJMBIvE0IbpFi23FOUByDYlItSYPPJmKdhvJQYsg/edit#)
* Started to see SLSA to be published in NTIA, etc. as a reference (inbound references and outbound references) 
    * Brandon currently working with NIST to potentially add SLSA to SSDF
* From the SIG charter: “Government and industry widely accept SLSA as the lingua franca of supply chain security”
* Recognize there are other governments (non-US) emerging standards.  (What is EU/APAC reference to SSDF, merging regulation across the world
* CCM - good reference of a framework that goes across various countries
* Will be a lot of work to get SLSA to be the one standard. (Roy)
* Cross mapping would help identify how SLSA would meet those requirements
* What is the extension mechanism? (not one and done; its constantly evolving)
* SLSA standard v1 ; if we are slsa compliant what happens with v2 compliance? 
* Being discussed in the specification working group
* Need to have organizations educated on SLSA; when supply chain security topic arises, SLSA is top of mind
* SLSA is one piece of SCS ; (roy)
* +1 Isaac - paint the picture of the entire puzzle 
* +1 Jay – paint the picture of what SLSA isn’t.  What the use is intended for; what audience needs the standard/framework? This is our value proposition.
* Other spinoffs ; we need to funnel to one spot;  how to know when to use one technology vs the other; be crisp where we stop (roy)
* Mike - make clear the distinction between slsa, attestation specifications; what is the builder responsible for vs project. You may have additional responsibilities outside of existing slsa provided tools.  
    * Isaac -> presentation on attestation  
* Parth - nist 800-53 etc.  (**pivot to existing efforts)**
* Existing Efforts
* SLSA Positioning Blog [https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/pull/426](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/pull/426) 
* Original blog post- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vn-ppR7eOFc1DMyczjsmpN3tz-jsiFOfzwnSNti-Sbg/edit#heading=h.xuz67jyns3n6
* isaac reviewed, how we publish our work; build out core project and core slsa documentation; when do we put it in a blog post, vs core documentation)
* Mapping Spreadsheet [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P_xxMlyF5iPV51CqIk8_EhI57aR6wf1Gkrg8sRHBMMQ/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P_xxMlyF5iPV51CqIk8_EhI57aR6wf1Gkrg8sRHBMMQ/edit#gid=0) 
* Potential new Efforts
* If there is a requirement that is from a government ; what happens to the specification?
* Melba - perhaps something for the spec group; collaboration between spec + positioning; 
* Roy - Is there a backdoor where government influences SLSA (i.e. SSDF); 
* Isaac - What is the criteria when making a decision to include/not include into specification
* Mike -How deep does slsa go? We have to defer to ‘constituent members’ across the world.  I.e. may not apply to a specific standard.
* Do we want a monthly meeting with specification + positioning to sync? (Jay)
    * SLSA bi-weekly currently too broad for 
    * There has to be room for competitive advantage vs pulling SLSA specific tooling
    * How can we respond using other resources
* E2E Supply Chain Framework Positioning (Melba)

How do we handle these??



* Mike - a github issue might be a good way to start; document discussion on how to implement, describe if its complementary, etc.  
* +1 isaac ; describe the problem space (maybe the scs framework) regardless of the diff specifications/regulations; it's more about picture to mapping the problems/overlapping
* Create 1 issue with all of these below to identify criteria for assessments
* Will need to create a common language (roy?)
* SLSA vs SCITT (formerly SCIM) [https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/scitt](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/scitt) (per Joshua Lock) (Roy currently doing a presentation; may be able to work on this)
* SCITT building blocks that all supply chain will need
* Here’s a common problem and here’s how the industry is going to solve it
* Microsoft, sigstore, google, etc. could implement an interface 
* “Electronic” notary; how do you audit that.; is there a summary endorsement to give the user a “yes/no” 
* Isaac - scitt is complementary to slsa 
* SLSA vs SPDX efforts (brought up by Brandon in last SLSA meeting)
* SLSA vs CIS Supply Chain Security Benchmark - [https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C029E4N3DPF/p1658505028588929](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C029E4N3DPF/p1658505028588929)
